The solution involves several key improvements. First, ensure that the Firebase configuration is correctly set up. Second, use error handling to gracefully manage network problems, and implement proper asynchronous techniques like `try...catch` for promises and `async/await` with error handling.  Third, verify the security rules in your Firebase project are not overly restrictive and allow the necessary access.   Finally, always test thoroughly in different network conditions to avoid unexpected behavior.
