The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the app is not properly initialized or if there's a problem connecting to the Firebase servers.  For instance, if your Firebase configuration is incorrect or if you're offline, you could encounter unexpected behavior.  Another less common issue is related to security rules that are too restrictive, leading to authorization errors even if the code seems correct.  Also, incorrect usage of asynchronous operations (like promises or async/await) with Firebase methods can cause race conditions or unhandled rejections.
